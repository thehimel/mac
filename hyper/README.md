# Hyper Terminal

This is a walkthrough to install and configure Hyper terminal in Mac.

## ZSH

* We use ZSH as our shell in this configuration. Presently, this is the default shell in Mac.
* Therefore, we do not need to install this.

## Oh My ZSH

* `Oh My Zsh is an open source, community-driven framework for managing your Zsh configuration.` - [ohmyz.sh](https://ohmyz.sh/).
* Install Oh My ZSH from [ohmyz.sh](https://ohmyz.sh/)

### Plugins

#### ZSH Auto suggestions

* [Install with Homebrew](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions/blob/master/INSTALL.md#homebrew)
* To edit the configuration file with vscode, you can use: `code ~/.zshrc`.
