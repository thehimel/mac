### Terraform

* [TFSwitch](https://tfswitch.warrensbox.com/) is used to easily switch between TF versions.
* You do not need to install Terraform separately if you install TFSwitch.
* Install with: `brew install warrensbox/tap/tfswitch`
* Installation guide: https://tfswitch.warrensbox.com/Installation/
* Once installed, you need to run `tfswitch` in the terminal at least once to install a TF version.
* You can switch between versions in the same way.
* You can verify with `terraform version`.
